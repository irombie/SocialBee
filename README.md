# Data Analysis on Neo4j and Visualization

This project's aim is to make some of the data analysis methods easy. 
Project contains a server (Spring Boot Application) and a UI which offers several data visualization techniques.

What you need to run the project:
(A Linux distro is obligator)

1)You need to have a local Neo4j Database. 

Dataset used in this project is the Movie Database, which includes 12k movies, 50k actors.  

You can either use the existing "neo4j-community-3.0.3" from this repository.

OR

You need to download a Neo4j database from here:
https://neo4j.com/download/
(Community edition is used in this project)

And for project to run you need to download the dataset from here:
https://neo4j.com/developer/example-data/
and put in into the "neo4j-community-YOURVERSION/data/databases/" and swap it with the initial graph.db if there exists.

And please disable Neo4j authentication from neo4j.conf file that is in conf folder of neo4j, by uncommenting the line:"dbms.security.auth_enabled=false"

2)You need to have a running Sprint Tool Suite(STS) application which can be downloaded from here:
https://spring.io/tools/sts/all
